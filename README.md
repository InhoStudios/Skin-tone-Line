# Skin-tone-Line

The Skin-tone Line Project is a multifaceted exploration into the existence of the skin-tone line, a line in HSV/CIELab colour space on which all shades of skin colour should lie.

## Directory Structure

This project directory has three main folders: `chromaphore separation`, `melanin absorption patterns`, and `skin segmentation`. 

## Chromaphore separation

This is an investigation into different computational models to take clinical images and produce hemoglobin and melanin component images.
