# Skin-tone Line
The skin-tone line is a hypothetical line that exists in the HSV colour-space along the hue axis that approximates skin colour across varying skin colours.

## Objective
I intend to investigate the presence and viability of this line, whether it is actually consistent among all skin colours, and observe it's application to dermatology research.

## Affiliations
This research is conducted under supervision of Dr. Tim Lee at the BC Cancer Research Institute, in the Photomedicine division.
